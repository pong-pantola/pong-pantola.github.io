title: Creating a Web Application using Gradle
permalink: /bluemix-combined-services/
---


Gradle has an available `war` plugin that allows you to package your Java web application into a `.war` file.

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a `.war` file.  The `.war` file will be deployed twice: locally (through a Jetty web server) and remotely (through [IBM Bluemix](https://ibm.biz/bluemixph)).

<br>

>**Prerequisite:**

>You are **required** to do the [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing).

>- The sample code used in the current tutorial is based from the sample code used in [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing). 

>You are not required (but **recommended**) to do the [Jetty Basics Tutorial](/jetty-basics).

>- **However**, ensure that your machine has the Jetty web server set-up as discussed in [Jetty Basics Tutorial](/jetty-basics).

>You are not required (but **recommended**) to do  the [Bluemix Basics Tutorial](/bluemix-basics).

>- **However**, ensure that you have a Bluemix account.  
>- Your account should have the space `dev` under the region `US-South`.  The creation of the space `dev` is discussed in [Bluemix Basics Tutorial](/bluemix-basics).
>- Make sure that the `cf` tool is installed.  The installation of `cf` tool is discussed in [Bluemix Basics Tutorial](/bluemix-basics).

####Copy Sample Codes from Git repository


1. Open a terminal window and create the directory `gradletemp` in the root directory.  Go to the created directory.

	```text		
	> mkdir gradletemp
	> cd gradletemp
	```

	<br>
	
1. Clone the git repository `https://github.com/pong-pantola/gradle-web-application.git` and go to the created `gradle-web-application` directory.

	```text
	> git clone https://github.com/pong-pantola/gradle-web-application.git
	> cd gradle-web-application
	```
 
	The `gradle-web-application` directory has a subdirectory `src`.

	```text
	gradle-web-application/
	|
	|----build.gradle
	|
	|----src/
	     |
	     |----main/
	     |    |
	     |    |----java/net/tutorial/
	     |    |             |
	     |    |             |----Math.java
	     |    |             |----Calculator.java
	     |    |
	     |    |----resources/
	     |    |    |
	     |    |    |----log4j.properties        
	     |    |
	     |    |----webapp/
	     |         |
	     |         |----calculator.jsp
	     |	     
	     |----test/
	          |
	          |----java/net/tutorial/
	                        |
	                        |----MyTest.java
	                        |----TestRunner.java	
	``` 

	The subdirectories and files are exactly the same as the one you used and created in [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing).  However, an additional file is added: `src/main/webapp/calculator.jsp`.

	`calculator.jsp` is the `.jsp` version of `Calculator.java`.

	The logical errors present in `Math.java` in the [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing) are already corrected in this tutorial's version of `Math.java`.

	<br>

####Review some of the Java classes and Build script


1. As mentioned, `Math.java`  logical errors in [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing) are already corrected.

	**Source code** of	`src/main/java/net/tutorial/Math.java`:
 
	```java
	package net.tutorial;
	
	public class Math{
	
	  //will be used in the multiply method to simulate that
	  //the multiply method is taking too long to execute
	  private void delay(){
	    try{
	      Thread.sleep(3000);//3000 msec. or 3 sec. delay
	    } catch(InterruptedException ex) {
	      Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
	    }
	  }
	
	  public int add(int a, int b){
	    return a+b;
	  }
	  
	  public int sub(int a, int b){
	    return a-b;
	  }  
	
	  public int multiply(int a, int b){
	    return a*b;
	  }
	}
	```
 
	 Remember that in the [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing), the method `add` had a logical error (i.e., instead of `a+b`;, the return statement is `a-b;`). 	In addition, a delay is inserted in the method `multiply` to demonstrate the timeout mechanism of JUnit.  These two issues are already resolved in this tutorial's version of `Math.java`. 
	
	<br>

1. `build.gradle` has the same content as the one you created in [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing).

	Please review the text below for the current content of `build.gradle`:


	```text
	apply plugin: 'java'
	
	repositories {
	    mavenCentral()
	}
	 
	dependencies {
	    compile 'log4j:log4j:1.2.17'
	    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
	}
	
	jar {
		from { configurations.compile.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) } }
	    manifest {
	        attributes 'Main-Class': 'net.tutorial.Calculator'
	    }
	}
	```

	Note that the contents of the above script are the same as the contents of `build.gradle` file that you completed in [Gradle's Unit Testing Tutorial](/gradle-unit-testing).  

	In this tutorial, entries related to web application (e.g., use of `.war` file) will be added to `build.gradle`.
	
	<br>
 
1. As mentioned, `calculator.jsp` is the `.jsp` version of `Calculator.java`.

	**Source code** of	`src/main/webapp/calculator.jsp`:
 
	```java
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" language="java" %>
	<%@ page import="net.tutorial.Math" %>
	<html>
	<head>
	    <title>Calculator</title>
	</head>
	<body>
	<%
	Math m = new Math();
	%>
	
	<%="5 + 9 = " + m.add(5, 9)%>
	<br>
	<%="8 - 2 = " + m.sub(8, 2)%>
	<br>
	<%="4 x 7 = " + m.multiply(4, 7)%>
	<br>
	
	</body>
	</html>
	```

	Note that similar to `Calculator.java`, `calculator.jsp` uses `Math.java`:
	
	```java
	<%@ page import="net.tutorial.Math" %>
	```

	<br>
	
####Update Build script to support Web Application
	
1. Update `build.gradle` to include `.war` related entries:

	```text
	apply plugin: 'java'
	
	apply plugin: 'war'
	
	war {
		archiveName 'calcuapp.war'
	}
	
	repositories {
	    mavenCentral()
	}
	 
	dependencies {
	    compile 'log4j:log4j:1.2.17'
	    testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
	}
	
	jar {
		from { configurations.compile.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) } }
	    manifest {
	        attributes 'Main-Class': 'net.tutorial.Calculator'
	    }
	}
	```

	Take note that the following were added in the script above:

	```text
	apply plugin: 'war'
	
	war {
		archiveName 'calcuapp.war'
	}
	```
	
	The `apply plugin: 'war'` entry will provide capability to Gradle to create a `war` file.

	The entry containing `archiveName 'calcuapp.war'` is added so that when the `.war` file is created, its name is `calcuapp.war`.  If you omit this entry, the name of the `.war` file is the name of the directory containing the project.  As an example, if `archiveName 'calcuapp.war'` is omitted, the `.war` file will be named `gradle-web-application.war`.

	<br>

1. Assemble the Gradle project.

	> Make sure that you are in the `gradle-web-application` directory before issuing the command below.

	```text
	> gradle assemble
	```

	**Output:**
		
	```text
	:compileJava
	:processResources
	:classes
	:war
	:assemble
	
	BUILD SUCCESSFUL
	
	Total time: 9.289 secs
	```
	
	The `build` directory and its subdirectories and files are created.

     	In this tutorial, the most important file that was created is the `build/libs/calcuapp.war` file.  This is the `.war` file containing the web application.


	<br>

####Deploy the Web Application in Jetty

1. Copy `calcuapp.war` found in the `build/libs/` subdirectory to Jetty's `webapps` subdirectory.

	>Refer to [Jetty Basics Tutorial](/jetty-basics) if your machine do not have the Jetty web server.
	
1. Make sure that the Jetty web server is running.

	>To start the Jetty web server
	>- open another terminal window
	>- go to Jetty's home directory
	>- issue the command `java -jar start.jar`.

1. On a web browser, go to [`http://localhost:8080/calcuapp/calculator.jsp`](http://localhost:8080/calcuapp/calculator.jsp).

	**Output:**
		
	```text
	5 + 9 = 14
	8 - 2 = 6
	4 x 7 = 28 
	```

	You have successfully deployed the calculator application in Jetty.


	<br>

####Deploy the Web Application in Bluemix

1. Login to your Bluemix account using the `cf` tool.

	> Make sure that you are in the `gradle-web-application` directory before issuing the command below.

	```text
	> cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net -s dev
	```

	<br>
	
1. Upload the web application to your Bluemix account.

	```text
	> cf push calculator-<your_name> -m 256M -p build/libs/calcuapp.war
	```

	**Example:**
		
	```text
	> cf push calculator-pong -m 256M -p build/libs/calcuapp.war
	```

	<br>
	
1. On a web browser, go to `http://calculator-<your_name>.mybluemix.net/calculator.jsp`.

	**Output:**
		
	```text
	5 + 9 = 14
	8 - 2 = 6
	4 x 7 = 28 
	```

	You have successfully deployed the calculator application in Bluemix.

	<br>

####Clean up

1. Delete your Bluemix application `calculator-<your_name>`.

1. Delete `calcuapp.war` from Jetty's `webapps` subdirectory.
	>You may need to stop the Jetty web server to delete `calcuapp.war`.
